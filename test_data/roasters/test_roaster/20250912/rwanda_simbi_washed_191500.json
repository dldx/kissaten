  "description": "Hailing from the fertile lands of Rwanda, the Simbi coffee is a testament to the dedication of producer Abdul Rudahunga. Grown at an impressive elevation of 1800 meters in the Huye region, this Washed Bourbon varietal coffee offers a truly remarkable tasting experience. Each sip unfolds with vibrant notes of Blood Orange and Apricot, balanced by a rich sweetness of Brown Sugar, culminating in a beautifully rounded mouthfeel. This coffee is not just a beverage; it's a journey to the heart of Rwandan coffee cultivation, promising a cup that is both complex and immensely satisfying.",

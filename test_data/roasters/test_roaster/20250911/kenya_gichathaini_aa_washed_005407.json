  "description": "This is a Kenyan coffee from the Nyeri region, known for its high-quality beans. The Gichathaini Factory is part of a cooperative that processes cherries from smallholder farmers. The coffee is washed, which emphasizes its bright acidity and clean flavors. Expect notes of pomelo, black berry, and hibiscus tea, with a smooth, sugarcane-like sweetness.",
